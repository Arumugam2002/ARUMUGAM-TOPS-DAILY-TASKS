    <blockquote><p>Harley-Davidson was founded in 1903 in Milwaukee, WI and officially incorporated in 1907, with Walter Davidson acting as the first president. Arthur Davidson became the first general sales manager and the secretary, while William Davidson was the first works manager. William Harley, meanwhile, became the chief engineer and treasurer.</p>

        <p>William was the first chief engineer and treasurer of Harley-Davidson. The idea for the motorcycle was his, although he certainly couldn't have done it without the Davidson brothers.</p>
    
        <p>Harley first began tinkering with the idea of a motorcycle while working at Barth Manufacturing Company. Throughout the years, he would build on the successes of his previous models. When the first models were completed in 1903 with a buckle crank, Harley was already trying to figure out how to create a two-cylinder engine, which he did by 1909.
    
        Harley would remain the company's chief engineer and treasurer until his death. He was an indispensable facet of the company's success and crucial in developing and introducing new bikes. An avid racer, he also had the pleasure of testing his latest creations.</p></blockquote>

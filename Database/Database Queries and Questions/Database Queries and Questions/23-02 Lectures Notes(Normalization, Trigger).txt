Trigger

A trigger in SQL is a stored procedure that automatically executes in response to a specific event, such as an INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or TRUNCATE statement, on a specified table or view.


Q.3.) What are the benefits of using SQL triggers?

Answer:- The benefits of using SQL triggers include:- 

Data integrity:- Triggers allow you to enforce complex business rules and constraints at the database levels, ensuring that data remains consistent and accurate.

Automation:- Triggers can automate repetitive or complex tasks by executing predefined actions whenever a specified event occurs. This reduces the need for manual intervention and improves efficiency.

Audit trails:- Triggers can be used to track changes made to data, such as logging modifications in a separate audit table. This helps in auditing and maintaining a history of data changes.

Data validation:- Triggers can perform additional validation checks on data before it is inserted, updated, or deleted, ensuring that only valid and conforming data is stored in the database.
